# Leveraging LLM for Airflow log Analysis And Resolution Steps.

## Objective

To utilize the LLM's to automatically interpret airflow logs and provide actionable resolution steps, thereby enhancing our workflow reliability and reducing downtime.

## Background

Airflow's extensive logging capabilities are essential for debugging and auditing. However,the manual analysis of these logs can be time-consuming. By leveraging LLM's we can automate this process enaabling quicker identification of issues and proactive system maintenance.

## Proposed Solution

Integrate LLM's into airflow environment to :

Automate logs analysis : Upon task failure, trigger an LLM to parse and interpret the relevant logs.

Provide resolution steps : Generate and email actionable resolution steps based on the log analysis

## Expected Outcome

Improved Responsiveness : Automated , immediate insights into task failures

Enhanced Efficiency : Reduction in manual log analysis time, allowing the team to focus on implementing solutions

Knowledge repository: Accumulation of analysed logs and resolutions for future reference and learning
